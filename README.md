# ZoomAutoJoiner
A simple program I wrote that autojoins zoom links without having to open the browser.
## Usage
Either run the script with `python3 zoomautojoiner.py` or `python zoomautojoiner.py` or run the EXE file.
Run with `-verbose` argument to show extra information. I use this to see whether the parsing worked correctly.
## Format of `meetings.txt`
`<time in 24hour format> <zoom meeting link>`
## Requirments
Python3 and nothing else alternatively you can natively run this on windows with the binary.The script should work on both windows and POSIX systems. 
## Binaries
.exe (recommended for windows users as it doesnt pause out of focus) binaries are available in the `binaries` folder. The folder also contains the SHA256 and MD5 checksum of the file. Be sure to verify the files before running.
## Notes
If you find a bug raise it on github. Also see if I have already patched it because the script doesnt auto update.

# ZoomAutoJoiner
A simple program I wrote that autojoins zoom links without having to open the browser.
# Format of `meetings.txt`
`<time in 24hour format> <zoom meeting link>`
# OS dependancy 
This program should work on both windows and POSIX systems. 
# Binaries
.exe (recommended for windows users as it doesnt pause out of focus) binaries are available in the `binaries` folder. The folder also contains the SHA256 and MD5 checksum of the file. Be sure to verify the files before running.
